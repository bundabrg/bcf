## What is bcf

`bcf` is a Command Management tool suitable for use in Bukkit/Spigot/PaperMC, Bungeecord, and Standalone (JLine based) 
though it may support other platforms in the near future.

It allows one to easily provide full command completion for all your commands as
well as automatically resolve and marshal input from the user so your command
gets the data it is expecting to get. For example if your command is expecting a player
name then available players will be provided during command completion and your command 
method will receive the actual player object, or the command sender will receive an error
explaining what the error is.

This library is inspired by aikar's [Annotation Command Framework (ACF)](https://github.com/aikar/commands) which used
before I decided on the crazy idea of writing my own to support some extra
features I felt I desperately needed for some reason. The name `bcf` is used in recognition of that.


## Features

* Supports Bukkit (Spigot/PaperMC), Bungeecoord and Standalone

* Define your commands by simply extending a BaseCommand derived class (like `BukkitCommand`) and annotating it with
  a `@Command` to define it, with any aliases separated by a `|`.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Command("mycmd|my|m")
        public class MyCommand extends BukkitCommand {
            ...
        }
        ```
        All of `/mycmd`, `/my`, `/m` are valid commands with the latter 2 designated as aliases.

* Register the class with the manager. For example in a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper based plugin you would use `BukkitManager`

    !!! example
        ```java
        public final class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
            public void onEnable() {
                BukkitCommandManager bcf = new BukkitCommandManager(this);
                bcf.registerCommand(new MyCommand());
            }
        }
        ```

* Annotate your method with `@Arg` to define what arguments it is expecting. This is a string of arguments that may
  consume 0 or more words from a users input both to provide command completion and to fully resolve and pass
  objects to the method.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("give|g @player(required=true, default=%self, mode=online)")
        public void onGive(CommandSender sender, Player player) {  
            ...
        }
        ```

* Multiple annotations can be used and each will be checked in turn.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("give|g @player(required=true, default=%self, mode=online)")
        @Arg("sudo give @player(required=true, default=%self, mode=online)")
        public void onGive(CommandSender sender, Player player) {  
            ...
        }
        ```

* Nearly all annotations can be added to your class to apply to all methods (and child classes). 

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Command("do")
        @Arg("for @player(required=true, mode=offline)")
        class MyCommand extends BukkitCommand {

            @Arg("tpto @world")
            public void doThis(CommandSender, Player player, World world) {
                ...
            }
        }
        ```
        To reach doThis the command is: `/do for <playername> tpto <worldname>`

* Your class can add itself as a child of another command class to inherit any of its settings. For example a 3rd party
  plugin could extend your command class to add sub-commands under your own. This is done by registering the sub-class
  with the manager with the `registerSubCommand` method.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("sudo")
        class MySubCommand extends BukkitCommand {

            @Arg("kill")
            public void killPlayer(CommandSender, Player player) {
               ...
            }
        }
        ```

        ```java
          public final class AnotherPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
              public void onEnable() {
                  BukkitCommandManager bcf = new BukkitCommandManager(this);
                  bcf.registerSubCommand(MyCommand.class, new MySubCommand());
              }
          }
        ```
        To execute killPlayer the full command now is: `/do for <playername> sudo kill`


* Create command aliases by adding a `@Command` annotation to a derived class. This allows shortcut commands to jump
straight to a class. For example instead of `/command view playername` you can have `/cv playername`
as an alias

* When a command needs to send an error (for example a parameter is not valid) the class will look for a method
annotated with `@Error`.  If it fails to find one it will check all its parent classes until it reaches the default. This
allows you to override how errors are handled.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("sudo")
        class MySubCommand extends MyCommand {
            @Error
            void onError(CommandSender sender, String message) {
                sender.spigot().sendMessage(
                        new ComponentBuilder(message).color(ChatColor.GREEN).create()
                );
            }
            
            ...
        }
        ```
        Will show error in green when it occurs under the `sudo` subcommand otherwise will show the default
        red.

* When no command is reached a method annotated with `@Default` is looked for to handle things.  If no method is found
then every parent class is checked until it reaches the default which outputs "Invalid Command".  This can be used to
provide more help.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("sudo")
        class MySubCommand extends MyCommand {
            @Default
            void onDefault(CommandSender sender) {
                sender.spigot().sendMessage(
                        new ComponentBuilder("A totally unhelpful message.").color(ChatColor.YELLOW).create()
                );
            }
            
            ...
        }
        ```
        Will show "A totally unhelpful message" if no method is matched in this class (or its children), otherwise it
        will show the default message.

* Add permission requirements by annotating your class or methods with `@Permission`. The command sender must either be
console or have at least one of the permissions at each level to proceed otherwise both command completion and execution
will be ignored as if the arguments did not exist.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Permission("mycmd.admin")
        @Permission("mycmd.command.sudo")
        @Arg("sudo")
        class MySubCommand extends MyCommand {

            @Permission("mycmd.admin")
            @Arg("kill")
            public void killPlayer(CommandSender, Player player) {
               ...
            }
            
            @Arg("tickle")
            public void ticklePlayer(CommandSender, Player player) {
               ...
            }
            
            ...
        }
        ```
        The command sender neds to have `mycmd.admin` to be able to use either the `kill` or `tickle` subcommands. They
        need either `mycmd.admin` or `mycmd.command.sudo` to access the `tickle` command. Classes extending this
        one will respect the Permissons on their parent class.

* Support both required and optional positional parameters.  A required parameter must either have a default or
must have valid input provided. Optional parameters with no default and no input will be set to null.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("cmd1 @player(required=false)")
        public void cmd1(CommandSender, Player player) {
           ...
        }
        
        @Arg("cmd2 @player(required=true, default=%self, mode=offline)")
        public void cmd2(CommandSender, OfflinePlayer player) {
           ...
        }
        ```
        `cmd1` does not require a player which will resolve to null if no input provided. `cmd2` requires a player
        name but if none is provided then the value `%self` is provided which will resolve to the command sender if
        they are a player or return an error if not.

* As well as supporting positional parameters we support named parameters called `switches`.  To pass a switch the 
command sender uses `-<switchname> <value(s)>` and full command completion is provided.  A switch becomes available in the
chain of arguments once it is reached and it can have multiple aliases.  A non required switch with no default value
will be resolved to null. A required switch must be resolved by input sometime after the point it is defined otherwise
the command will be rejected.  Designating a switch parameter means it is no longer treated as positional.

    !!! example
        ```java
        @Arg("transfer @int(min=1,max=3) @player(switch='from|f') @player(switch='to|t') @item")
        public void doTransfer(CommandSender, Player from, Player to, Itemstack item) {
           ...
        }
        ```
        Valid commands would be:
        
        * `/mycmd transfer 3 -from Player1 -to Player2 diamond_sword`
        * `/mycmd transfer 3 diamond_sword -t Player2 -f Player1`
            
        This would not be valid:
        
        * `/mycmd transfer -from Player1 -to Player2 3 diamond_sword`
            
         
## Quickstart

1. Add the following Maven repository to your `pom.xml`
    ```xml
    <!-- Bundabrg's Repo -->
    <repository>
        <id>bundabrg-repo</id>
        <url>https://repo.worldguard.com.au/repository/maven-public</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>   
    ```

2. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>au.com.grieve.bcf</groupId>
        <artifactId>bukkit</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.9</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    !!! note
        Don't forget to check what the latest verison is as these documents may be out of date.

3. Shade the library into your own code by adding in your `pom.xml`

    ```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.2.3</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                           <goal>shade</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
                <configuration>
                    <relocations>
                        <relocation>
                            <pattern>au.com.grieve.bcf</pattern>
                            <shadedPattern>${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}.bcf</shadedPattern>
                        </relocation>
                    </relocations>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```
   
4. Create a command class that extends BukkitCommand
    
    ```java
    @Command("mycmd")
    public class MainCommand extends BukkitCommand {
       
        @Arg("list")
        public void doList(CommandSender sender) {
            sender.spigot().sendMessage(
                new ComponentBuilder("Reached List").color(ChatColor.GREEN).create()
            );
        }
    }
    ```
   
5. Create a new CommandManager in your plugin, passing your plugin as a parameter and register your commandclass.

    ```java
    // Setup Command Manager
    bcf = new BukkitCommandManager(this);
    
    // Register Commands
    bcf.registerCommand(new MainCommand());
    ```
   
6. You should now be able to use `/mycmd list` in-game.
